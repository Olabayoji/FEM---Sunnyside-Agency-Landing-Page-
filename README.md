# FEM---Sunnyside-Agency-Landing-Page-
This is a challenge from the frontend mentor challenge website. 
This was my first attempt at creating a landing page. I think i did faily well since the page is responsive across all devices. 
Although, code could have been cleaner.
Made use of;
- Flexbox
- Grids 
Oh, I also learnt about inset shadow box. Yay!!!
